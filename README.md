# CommunityJS

## About
CommunityJS is a Javascript library to interact directly with the community contract, it handles all the communication between the frontend and the SmartWeave contract that's available on the permaweb.

## Documentation
We have in place a full documentation of the functions community.js offers.

To get started you need to have community-js installed on your webpage or server. You can do this by using nodejs with:
```
npm install community-js@1.0.9
```

Or you can use the currently permaweb version for your frontend, using:
```html
<script src="https://arweave.net/aga8b9xqJVfUKGxQEYt65tVtlbu1fHScRyHtjgAY8vg"></script>
```
Or the minified version:
```html
<script src="https://arweave.net/a7PlxlxRklZUSOujnXF5Y8sFJfdRgIxiXgowSxRbqa4"></script>
```

### Version ^1.0.11
Note: Version 1.0.11 and higher require the Arweave instance to be connected to `arweave.dev` because of the use of GQL, which is still in development.

NodeJS Version:
```
npm install community-js
```

Permaweb version:
```
https://arweave.net/hs9HuBp8dxJ0h8Tjkl-HTuk0csqvUcc2GL7QR2muZH0

Minified:
